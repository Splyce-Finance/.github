# About Splyce

Splyce Finance goal is to track,  trade  &  grow  with  Solanaâ€™s  leading  assets.
Splyce DTFs (DeFi Traded Funds) give users one-click access to hot investment themes.
Splyce DTF tokens can be traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) and can immediately integrate with DeFi tools, providing utility to tokenized assets in a groundbreaking way.

Splyce works on bringing tokenized assets, such as ETFs, into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It enables these assets to move and interact like cryptocurrencies by offering permissionless and regulated access for both retail and institutional users.
This makes Splyce a pioneer in enabling borderless access to RWAs within DeFi ecosystems.
